## About Our Work

All lab and project work is written in C and runs on a / two CC3200 LaunchPad(s). Development tools used include Code Composer Studio (CSS) Integrated Development Environment (v9.3.0), CC3200 Software Development Kit (v1.4.0) and CC3200SDK-ServicePack (v1.0.1.13-2.11.0.1).

We invite you to read our reports for more details regarding what we have done.

To test our code, we recommend you to clone this repository / download all files and unzip them in an empty folder. Upon opening the IDE and after selecting the folder as the workspace, choose `Import CCS Projects` followed by `Select archive file` with the `.zip` file of interest. Alternatively, importing an unzipped folder should also work.
